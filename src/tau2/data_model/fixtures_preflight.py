"""Preflight-requirements fixtures for the paired re-scoring pilot.

Each fixture builder loads the *real* τ³ scenario from the shipped task data and attaches a
typed `UserPreflightRequirements` to it via the optional `user_preflight_requirements`
field, so `task_instructions` (and every other scenario field) is preserved byte-for-byte by
construction (not retyped by hand). Only `user_preflight_requirements` is added, and every
constraint's `source_quote` is a verbatim substring of the real task prose (assert this with
`verify_provenance`).

Task 47 (airline) is the canonical "revealed but missed" case: the user states an explicit
refusal to be transferred, but τ³'s DB/COMMUNICATE grader has no predicate for it.
